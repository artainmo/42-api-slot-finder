# 42-slot-finder

Script to find slots via the 42API. Project that needs to be evaluated and student campus can be specified.<br>
Made for mac.

### Run

1. Setup with following command and follow instructions.
```
make setup
```

2. Launch
```
make CAMPUS=<your-campus-city> PROJECT=<project-to-be-evaluated>
```

### Problem
For some reason the found slots do not translate to slots one can actually find on the intranet...

### Next trial via webscraping static HTML
